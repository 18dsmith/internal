            The Ceaser Cypher is an algorithm which you can use as a basic way to encrypt words/messages. However, nowadays this way of encryption is way too easy to crack so I don't reccomend using it. How it works is you take a letter from the alphabet, and either shift it forward an amount of letters or backwards an amount of letters. The amount you shift it is based on your key. If your key is 3, then shift it 3 forward in the alphabet. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. If you reach Z while going forward, you reset back to A. So for instance, if your key is still 3 and you get to Y, you would go Z-A-B, your new letter would be B.<br>
